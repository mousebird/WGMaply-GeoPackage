# GeoPackage WKB iOS

#### GeoPackage Well Known Binary Lib ####

The [GeoPackage Libraries](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/) were developed at the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](http://www.nga.mil/) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](http://www.bit-sys.com/).

### About ###

[WKB](http://ngageoint.github.io/geopackage-wkb-ios/) is an iOS Objective-C library for writing and reading Well-Known Binary Geometries to and from bytes. The library includes a hierarchy of Geometry objects. Although developed as part of the [GeoPackage Libraries](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/), this library does not contain GeoPackage functionality and can be used separately.

### Usage ###

View the latest [Appledoc on CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/wkb-ios)

#### Read ####

    //NSData * bytes = ...    
    
    WKBByteReader * reader = [[WKBByteReader alloc] initWithData:bytes];
    [reader setByteOrder:CFByteOrderBigEndian];
    WKBGeometry * geometry = [WKBGeometryReader readGeometryWithReader:reader];
    WKBGeometryType geometryType = geometry.geometryType;

#### Write ####

    //WKBGeometry * geometry = ...
    
    WKBByteWriter * writer = [[WKBByteWriter alloc] init];
    [writer setByteOrder:CFByteOrderBigEndian];
    [WKBGeometryWriter writeGeometry:geometry withWriter:writer];
    NSData * bytes = [writer getData];
    [writer close];

### Swift ###

To use from Swift, import the wkb-ios bridging header from the Swift project's bridging header

    #import "wkb-ios-Bridging-Header.h"

#### Read ####

    // let bytes: NSData = ...
    
    let reader: WKBByteReader = WKBByteReader(data: bytes);
    reader.byteOrder = Int(CFByteOrderBigEndian.rawValue);
    let geometry: WKBGeometry = WKBGeometryReader.readGeometryWithReader(reader);
    let geometryType: WKBGeometryType = geometry.geometryType;

#### Write ####

    //let geometry: WKBGeometry = ...
    
    let writer: WKBByteWriter = WKBByteWriter();
    writer.byteOrder = Int(CFByteOrderBigEndian.rawValue);
    WKBGeometryWriter.writeGeometry(geometry, withWriter: writer);
    let bytes: NSData = writer.getData();
    writer.close();
